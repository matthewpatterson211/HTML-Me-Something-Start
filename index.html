               <h2>Goose</h2>
               <p id = "mainHeading">Here my cat Goose. He is orange and crazy. I got him in 2020, a friend of mine found a cat in his garage and his whole family is allergic to cats so he called me. The rest is history.

            <h2>Lola</h2>
            <p id = "testP" class = "funParagraph">Here is my cat Lola. She is a big fan of social distancing. She is a fan of me but if you don't know her and try to touch, you do so at your own risk.

            <p>Megatron is technically a friends cat but we recently had to watch him so I am including him anyway. He got seperated from his mom a little early so we had to bottle feed him.
